## Core Concept

The player manages a heavily armored, steampunk train designed to survive a zombie apocalypse.
The train moves and fights automatically. The player's agency comes from making strategic upgrade choices at fortified stations to optimize the train's performance, build, and survivability against increasingly massive hordes of the undead.

## Guiding Design Pillars

1. **Perpetual Momentum:** The train is an unstoppable force, always pushing forward. Its speed is a resource to be managed, not directly controlled. Hitting zombies will slow it, threatening a complete stop—and doom.
2. **The Strategic Engineer:** The player is the "mind" of the train. The game is not won by reflexes, but by smart, predictive build design (e.g., "Do I need more speed, or more guns to *maintain* my speed?").
3. **Escalating Scale:** The game starts with one gun and a few zombies. It must scale to a screen-filling spectacle of auto-cannons, explosions, and hundreds of enemies, all while maintaining web performance.

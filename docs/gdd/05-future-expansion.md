# 05: Future Expansion Areas

This document contains a backlog of speculative ideas for expanding the game's systems and content in versions beyond V3.0.

* **Weapons (Deep Dive):**
  * **Advanced Targeting Modes:** Beyond the V3.0 "Target Strongest/Fastest," we can introduce more sophisticated AI targeting behaviors as high-tier upgrades:
    * **`Intercept`:** Aims at fast-moving enemies with a slight lead, predicting their path. Ideal for shooting down projectiles or hitting Runners.
    * **`Highest Threat`:** A complex algorithm that prioritizes special enemies based on a threat score (e.g., a Spitter is higher threat than a Shambler).
    * **`Densest Cluster`:** For AOE weapons, this AI calculates the optimal firing solution to maximize the number of enemies hit in a single blast.
  * **Types:** Flamethrowers (cone AOE), Mortars (lobbed AOE), Railguns (piercing).
  * **Energy:** Introduce a "Power" resource generated by the Engine. Guns *consume* Power. This adds a new balance layer (`Power Generation` vs. `Power Consumption`).
* **"Special" Zombies:**
  * **`Tank`:** High HP, high mass (causes *massive* slowdown on ram).
  * **`Spitter`:** A ranged enemy that fires projectiles at the train, forcing the need for point-defense.
  * **`Shrieker`:** Does no damage, but *buffs* all other zombies (e.g., +Speed, +HP).
* **Active Abilities:**
  * To add *some* in-run agency back, the player could have 1-2 "panic buttons" that charge up.
  * **`[Steam Vent]`:** A one-time AOE blast that clears zombies near the train.
  * **`[Manual Brake]`:** (High risk) Slam on the brakes to avoid a `Tank`, but lose all speed.
* **Station Management:**
  * **Survivors:** Rescue survivors on runs to add as "Staff" at the Station, providing passive bonuses (e.g., "Engineer" = +5% `Regen`).
  * **Resource Trading:** (V4.0+) Trade `Scrap` for `Fuel`, `Food`, or `Tech` (new upgrade trees).

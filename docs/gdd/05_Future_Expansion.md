# 05: Future Expansion Areas

This document contains a backlog of speculative ideas for expanding the game's systems and content in versions beyond V3.0.

*   **Weapons (Deep Dive):**
    *   **Types:** Flamethrowers (cone AOE), Mortars (lobbed AOE), Railguns (piercing).
    *   **Energy:** Introduce a "Power" resource generated by the Engine. Guns *consume* Power. This adds a new balance layer (`Power Generation` vs. `Power Consumption`).
*   **"Special" Zombies:**
    *   **`Tank`:** High HP, high mass (causes *massive* slowdown on ram).
    *   **`Spitter`:** A ranged enemy that fires projectiles at the train, forcing the need for point-defense.
    *   **`Shrieker`:** Does no damage, but *buffs* all other zombies (e.g., +Speed, +HP).
*   **Active Abilities:**
    *   To add *some* in-run agency back, the player could have 1-2 "panic buttons" that charge up.
    *   **`[Steam Vent]`:** A one-time AOE blast that clears zombies near the train.
    *   **`[Manual Brake]`:** (High risk) Slam on the brakes to avoid a `Tank`, but lose all speed.
*   **Station Management:**
    *   **Survivors:** Rescue survivors on runs to add as "Staff" at the Station, providing passive bonuses (e.g., "Engineer" = +5% `Regen`).
    *   **Resource Trading:** (V4.0+) Trade `Scrap` for `Fuel`, `Food`, or `Tech` (new upgrade trees).

This repository is "docs-first". All significant architectural changes must be proposed and accepted as an ADR before implementation. Small bug fixes, typo corrections, or minor refactors that do not alter the core architecture may skip the formal ADR process, but should still reference a relevant issue or ADR.

PR checklist:
- Include a link to the relevant ADR for any architectural changes.
- Add or update tests and performance benchmarks when modifying core systems.
- Ensure the CI pipeline passes successfully.

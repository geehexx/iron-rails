# Iron Rails Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the Iron Rails project. This directory contains the Game Design Document (GDD), in-depth technical analysis, and the framework for future project initiatives.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Game Design Document (`/gdd`)
This section contains the core design and vision for the game.

-   **[00-game-overview.md](./gdd/00-game-overview.md)**: The high-level concept, genre, and design pillars.
-   **[01-v1-core-prototype.md](./gdd/01-v1-core-prototype.md)**: The detailed specification for the initial, actionable prototype.
-   **[02-future-versions.md](./gdd/02-future-versions.md)**: The roadmap for iterative expansion (V1.5, V2.0, V3.0).
-   **[03-key-mechanics.md](./gdd/03-key-mechanics.md)**: A high-level overview of the core gameplay systems.
-   **[04-ui-ux-and-feedback.md](./gdd/04-ui-ux-and-feedback.md)**: Details on the user interface and the critical "juice" elements.
-   **[05-future-expansion.md](./gdd/05-future-expansion.md)**: A backlog of ideas for post-V3.0 content.

### 2. Technical Analysis (`/technical_analysis`)
This section contains deep-dive research, analysis, and recommendations for key technical challenges.

-   **[01-rendering-and-performance.md](./technical_analysis/01-rendering-and-performance.md)**: Analysis of Canvas vs. DOM, the recommendation for the Phaser framework, and an example of Object Pooling.
-   **[02-game-physics-and-formulas.md](./technical_analysis/02-game-physics-and-formulas.md)**: A mathematical analysis of the core slowdown formula with stable alternatives.
-   **[03-ai-and-algorithms.md](./technical_analysis/03-ai-and-algorithms.md)**: Research into efficient "target closest" algorithms for the auto-targeting system.
-   **[04-ui-ux-implementation.md](./technical_analysis/04-ui-ux-implementation.md)**: Best practices for implementing a responsive, web-centric game HUD.
-   **[05-recommended-project-setup.md](./technical_analysis/05-recommended-project-setup.md)**: A guide to setting up a modern, efficient development environment with Phaser, Vite, and Vitest.

### 3. Project Initiatives (`/initiatives`)
This section is for planning and tracking large-scale, multi-session work efforts.

-   **[README.md](./initiatives/README.md)**: An explanation of the initiative system.
-   **[template.md](./initiatives/template.md)**: The template for creating new initiative documents.

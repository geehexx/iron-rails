# Iron Rails Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the Iron Rails project. This directory contains the Game Design Document (GDD), in-depth technical analysis, and the framework for future project initiatives.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Game Design Document (`/gdd`)
This section contains the core design and vision for the game.

-   **[00_Game_Overview.md](./gdd/00_Game_Overview.md)**: The high-level concept, genre, and design pillars.
-   **[01_V1_Core_Prototype.md](./gdd/01_V1_Core_Prototype.md)**: The detailed specification for the initial, actionable prototype.
-   **[02_Future_Versions.md](./gdd/02_Future_Versions.md)**: The roadmap for iterative expansion (V1.5, V2.0, V3.0).
-   **[03_Key_Mechanics.md](./gdd/03_Key_Mechanics.md)**: A high-level overview of the core gameplay systems.
-   **[04_UI_UX_And_Feedback.md](./gdd/04_UI_UX_And_Feedback.md)**: Details on the user interface and the critical "juice" elements.
-   **[05_Future_Expansion.md](./gdd/05_Future_Expansion.md)**: A backlog of ideas for post-V3.0 content.

### 2. Technical Analysis (`/technical_analysis`)
This section contains deep-dive research, analysis, and recommendations for key technical challenges.

-   **[01_Rendering_And_Performance.md](./technical_analysis/01_Rendering_And_Performance.md)**: Analysis of Canvas vs. DOM, the recommendation for the Phaser framework, and an example of Object Pooling.
-   **[02_Game_Physics_And_Formulas.md](./technical_analysis/02_Game_Physics_And_Formulas.md)**: A mathematical analysis of the core slowdown formula with stable alternatives.
-   **[03_AI_And_Algorithms.md](./technical_analysis/03_AI_And_Algorithms.md)**: Research into efficient "target closest" algorithms for the auto-targeting system.
-   **[04_UI_UX_Implementation.md](./technical_analysis/04_UI_UX_Implementation.md)**: Best practices for implementing a responsive, web-centric game HUD.
-   **[05_Recommended_Project_Setup.md](./technical_analysis/05_Recommended_Project_Setup.md)**: A guide to setting up a modern, efficient development environment with Phaser, Vite, and Vitest.

### 3. Project Initiatives (`/initiatives`)
This section is for planning and tracking large-scale, multi-session work efforts.

-   **[README.md](./initiatives/README.md)**: An explanation of the initiative system.
-   **[template.md](./initiatives/template.md)**: The template for creating new initiative documents.

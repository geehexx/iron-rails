# Temporary Asset Documentation

The files in this directory are temporary placeholders for asset curation. They are intended to be replaced by a proper asset management system.

This directory and its contents should be removed once the asset management system is in place.

**Removal Tracking:**
- See tracking issue #TODO for removal and asset management system design.
- Acceptance criteria: Asset management ADR approved, implementation merged, asset ingestion workflow validated.

**Next Steps:**
- Asset management system design/ADR (see `docs/adr/` for architectural decisions)
- Migration from freesound, Kenney, and Open Game Art packs to formal asset management
